# TODO
# Segments are groups of people who share similar characteristics.
# - They can define grouping conditions that use the underlying data (schema) and potentially
#   use something like JSON Path https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html
# - They can define a name and description
# - They can be used to trigger flows => when person enters a segment, trigger a flow
